/**
 * A simple service-provider loading facility.
 *
 * <p>
 * A <i>service</i> is a well-known set of interfaces and (usually abstract)
 * classes. A <i>service provider</i> is a specific implementation of a service.
 * The classes in a provider typically implement the interfaces and subclass the
 * classes defined in the service itself. Service providers can be installed in
 * an implementation of the Java platform in the form of extensions, that is,
 * jar files placed into any of the usual extension directories. Providers can
 * also be made available by adding them to the application's class path or by
 * some other platform-specific means.
 *
 * <p>
 * For the purpose of loading, a service is represented by a single type, that
 * is, a single interface or abstract class. (A concrete class can be used, but
 * this is not recommended.) A provider of a given service contains one or more
 * concrete classes that extend this <i>service type</i> with data and code
 * specific to the provider. The <i>provider class</i> is typically not the
 * entire provider itself but rather a proxy which contains enough information
 * to decide whether the provider is able to satisfy a particular request
 * together with code that can create the actual provider on demand. The details
 * of provider classes tend to be highly service-specific; no single class or
 * interface could possibly unify them, so no such type is defined here. The
 * only requirement enforced by this facility is that provider classes must have
 * a zero-argument constructor so that they can be instantiated during loading.
 *
 * <p>
 * <a name="format"> A service provider is identified by placing a
 * <i>provider-configuration file</i> in the resource directory
 * <tt>META-INF/services</tt>.</a> The file's name is the fully-qualified
 * <a href="../lang/ClassLoader.html#name">binary name</a> of the service's
 * type. The file contains a list of fully-qualified binary names of concrete
 * provider classes, one per line. Space and tab characters surrounding each
 * name, as well as blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is
 * <tt>'#'</tt> (<tt>'&#92;u0023'</tt>, <font style="font-size:smaller;">NUMBER
 * SIGN</font>); on each line all characters following the first comment
 * character are ignored. The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
 *
 * <p>
 * If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one
 * configuration file, or is named in the same configuration file more than
 * once, then the duplicates are ignored. The configuration file naming a
 * particular provider need not be in the same jar file or other distribution
 * unit as the provider itself. The provider must be accessible from the same
 * class loader that was initially queried to locate the configuration file;
 * note that this is not necessarily the class loader from which the file was
 * actually loaded.
 *
 * <p>
 * Providers are located and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand. A service
 * loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so far. Each
 * invocation of the {@link #iterator iterator} method returns an iterator that
 * first yields all of the elements of the cache, in instantiation order, and
 * then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining providers, adding each one
 * to the cache in turn. The cache can be cleared via the {@link #reload reload}
 * method.
 *
 * <p>
 * Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller. Trusted
 * system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and the
 * methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged security
 * context.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 *
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified, passing a <tt>null</tt> argument to any method in
 * this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * <span style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 1em">Example</span> Suppose we
 * have a service type <tt>com.example.CodecSet</tt> which is intended to
 * represent sets of encoder/decoder pairs for some protocol. In this case it is
 * an abstract class with two abstract methods:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public abstract Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
 * 
 * public abstract Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Each method returns an appropriate object or <tt>null</tt> if the provider
 * does not support the given encoding. Typical providers support more than one
 * encoding.
 *
 * <p>
 * If <tt>com.example.impl.StandardCodecs</tt> is an implementation of the
 * <tt>CodecSet</tt> service then its jar file also contains a file named
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * META - INF / services / com.example.CodecSet
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * This file contains the single line:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * com.example.impl.StandardCodecs    # Standard codecs
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <tt>CodecSet</tt> class creates and saves a single service instance at
 * initialization:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * private static ServiceLoader&lt;CodecSet&gt; codecSetLoader = ServiceLoader.load(CodecSet.class);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * To locate an encoder for a given encoding name it defines a static factory
 * method which iterates through the known and available providers, returning
 * only when it has located a suitable encoder or has run out of providers.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public static Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName) {
 * 	for (CodecSet cp : codecSetLoader) {
 * 		Encoder enc = cp.getEncoder(encodingName);
 * 		if (enc != null)
 * 			return enc;
 * 	}
 * 	return null;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <tt>getDecoder</tt> method is defined similarly.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * <span style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 1em">Usage Note</span> If the
 * class path of a class loader that is used for provider loading includes
 * remote network URLs then those URLs will be dereferenced in the process of
 * searching for provider-configuration files.
 *
 * <p>
 * This activity is normal, although it may cause puzzling entries to be created
 * in web-server logs. If a web server is not configured correctly, however,
 * then this activity may cause the provider-loading algorithm to fail
 * spuriously.
 *
 * <p>
 * A web server should return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) response when a requested
 * resource does not exist. Sometimes, however, web servers are erroneously
 * configured to return an HTTP 200 (OK) response along with a helpful HTML
 * error page in such cases. This will cause a {@link ServiceConfigurationError}
 * to be thrown when this class attempts to parse the HTML page as a
 * provider-configuration file. The best solution to this problem is to fix the
 * misconfigured web server to return the correct response code (HTTP 404) along
 * with the HTML error page.
 *
 * @param <S> The type of the service to be loaded by this loader
